Failure is foremost, and success is secondary. Web developers in any scope are failures, and proudly so. Development implies change, taking what is available and changing it into something new or different. Many times in history, we have had an unanticipated outcome that created something innovative. Failure is not an option to the skeptic, and a skeptic would say, “avoid failure at all cost.” Failure, however scary and trepidatious, is an option and a good one too.

One of the best examples of success from failures is “Percy Spencer,” a self-taught electrical engineer. While working on an active radar, Percy Spencer noticed that the microwaves had melted a chocolate bar in his coat pocket. Eighty years later, nearly everyone in America has that failure sitting on their kitchen counter. Percy was not trying to build the microwave But, look at the impact it has had on our society.

To indirectly address the skeptic, who believes that failure is not an option. It is easy to confuse failure with apathy because giving it “the old college try” does not cut it. Failing means putting in the time and effort to seek growth and innovation. To quote the great Lucile Ball — “ I would rather regret the things I have done than regret the things I have not done.” Failure is the pursuit of success, and what defines a person is not how they celebrate victory, no. What defines a person is their capacity to fail. I would Like to believe that I’m a failure through and through.
